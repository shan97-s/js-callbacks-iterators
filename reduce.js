// BONUS ONLY: Look up docs to read about reduce, which takes an array and distills it into a single value.

let numbers = [1, 56, 2, 4, 1, 99, 3, 5];

const num=numbers.reduce(check);
function check(total,current){
    return total*current;
}


// Your code here!

// Write something that takes the above array and returns the product of all the numbers
// via multiplication
